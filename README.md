# Readium.js
Extend the Readium project to the world wide web.


The installation script will do the following:

1. [Install node.js and node's package manager](http://nodejs.org/download/)
2. Run "npm install". This uses npm to download and install the rest of the dependencies for the project. (They are listed in package.json, if you're curious.)
3. Run "grunt". Grunt is a build script, like Make, that will ready the Readium web components for release.

## Sample
For sample usage of Readium.js pleas have a look at [readium-js-viewer](https://github.com/readium/readium-js-viewer) implementation.
