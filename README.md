# readium-js
## Branch specific - feature/readium2

The goal of this feature branch is to "Create a Readium 2 compatible navigator based on
Readium 1 project".

For now the focus is to interface with Readium 2 streamer adopting WebPub manifest data model 
as a principal for all the subsequent processing.

If you have URI pointing to ePub processed by Readium 2 streamer, you can point
Readium 1 viewer to this URI and see the book rendered.

Here is an example:
- Assuming that you processed ePub by Readium 2 streamer and got this URI:
`http://localhost:60217/L1VzZXJzL21pY2hhZWxzL2VwL3JlYWRpdW0vcmVhZGl1bS1qcy12aWV3ZXIvdGVzdHMvZXB1YnMvYWNjZXNzaWJsZV9lcHViXzMuZXB1Yg==/manifest.json`
- URL encode the value above, getting this:
`http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A60217%2FL1VzZXJzL21pY2hhZWxzL2VwL3JlYWRpdW0vcmVhZGl1bS1qcy12aWV3ZXIvdGVzdHMvZXB1YnMvYWNjZXNzaWJsZV9lcHViXzMuZXB1Yg%3D%3D%2Fmanifest.json%0A`
- Assuming that you are running HTTP server in readium/readium-js-viewer on port
  8090, use this URL to point Reader to WebPub:
`http://localhost:8090/dev/index_RequireJS_no-optimize_LITE.html?epub=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A60217%2FL1VzZXJzL21pY2hhZWxzL2VwL3JlYWRpdW0vcmVhZGl1bS1qcy12aWV3ZXIvdGVzdHMvZXB1YnMvYWNjZXNzaWJsZV9lcHViXzMuZXB1Yg%3D%3D%2Fmanifest.json%0A`
- See EPUB content rendered.

**Note** that this is WIP, so far we have basic rendering, pagination and TOC
working.

## General
**EPUB core processing engine written in Javascript.**

This is a software component used by the Readium Chrome extension and the "cloud reader" ( https://github.com/readium/readium-js-viewer ).

Please see https://github.com/readium/readium-shared-js for more information about the underlying rendering engine.

You can try Readium here:

* Online "cloud reader" demo: https://readium.firebaseapp.com
* Chrome extension (can be used offline): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readium/fepbnnnkkadjhjahcafoaglimekefifl

## Prerequisites

* A decent terminal. On Windows, GitShell works great ( http://git-scm.com ), GitBash works too ( https://msysgit.github.io ), and Cygwin adds useful commands ( https://www.cygwin.com ).
* NodeJS ( https://nodejs.org ) **v4+** (Note that NodeJS v6+ and NPM v3+ are now supported, including NodeJS v7+ and NPM v4+)
* Optionally: Yarn ( https://yarnpkg.com ) **v0.23+**


## Development

**Initial setup:**

* `git submodule update --init --recursive` to ensure that the readium-js chain of dependencies is initialised (readium-shared-js and readium-cfi-js)
* `git checkout BRANCH_NAME && git submodule foreach --recursive "git checkout BRANCH_NAME"` to switch to the desired BRANCH_NAME
* `npm run prepare:all` (to perform required preliminary tasks, like patching code before building)
* OR: `yarn run prepare:yarn:all` (to use Yarn instead of NPM for node_module management)

Note that in some cases, administrator rights may be needed in order to install dependencies, because of NPM-related file access permissions (the console log would clearly show the error). Should this be the case, running `sudo npm run prepare:all` usually solves this.

Note that the above command executes the following:

* `npm install` (to download dependencies defined in `package.json` ... note that the `--production` option can be used to avoid downloading development dependencies, for example when testing only the pre-built `build-output` folder contents)
* `npm update` (to make sure that the dependency tree is up to date)

**Typical workflow:**

No RequireJS optimization:

* `npm run http` (to launch an http server. This automatically opens a web browser instance to the HTML files in the `dev` folder, choose `index_RequireJS_no-optimize.html`, or the `*LITE.html` variant which do include only the reader view, not the ebook library view)
* Hack away! (e.g. source code in the `src/js` folder)
* Press F5 (refresh / reload) in the web browser

Or to use optimized Javascript bundles (single or multiple):

* `npm run build` (to update the RequireJS bundles in the build output folder)
* `npm run http:watch` (to launch an http server. This automatically opens a web browser instance to the HTML files in the `dev` folder, choose `index_RequireJS_single-bundle.html` or `index_RequireJS_multiple-bundles.html`, or the `*LITE.html` variants which do include only the reader view, not the ebook library view)
* `npm run http` (same as above, but without watching for file changes (no automatic rebuild))

**Plugins integration:**

When invoking the `npm run build` command, the generated `build-output` folder contains RequireJS module bundles that include the default plugins specified in `readium-js-shared/plugins/plugins.cson` (see the `readium-js-shared/PLUGINS.md` documentation). Developers can override the default plugins configuration by using an additional file called `plugins-override.cson`. This file is git-ignored (not persistent in the Git repository), which means that Readium's default plugins configuration is never at risk of being mistakenly overridden by developers, whilst giving developers the possibility of creating custom builds on their local machines.

For example, the `annotations` plugin can be activated by adding it to the `include` section in `readium-js-shared/plugins/plugins-override.cson`.
This way, after invoking `npm run http`, the `./dev/index*.html` demo apps can be used to create / remove highlighted selections in the web browser.   

## NPM (Node Package Manager)

All packages "owned" and maintained by the Readium Foundation are listed here: https://www.npmjs.com/~readium

Note that although Node and NPM natively use the CommonJS format, Readium modules are currently only defined as AMD (RequireJS).
This explains why Browserify ( http://browserify.org ) is not used by this Readium project.
More information at http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html and http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html

* Make sure `npm install readium-js` completes successfully ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/readium-js )
* Execute `npm run http`, which opens a web browser to a basic RequireJS bootstrapper located in the `dev` folder (this is *not* a fully-functioning application!)
* To see an actual application that uses this "readium-js" component, try "readium-js-viewer" ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/readium-js-viewer )

Note: the `--dev` option after `npm install readium-js` can be used to force the download of development dependencies,
but this is kind of pointless as the code source and RequireJS build configuration files are missing.
See below if you need to hack the code.


## How to use (RequireJS bundles / AMD modules)

The `build-output` directory contains common CSS styles, as well as two distinct folders:

### Single bundle

The `_single-bundle` folder contains `readium-js_all.js` (and its associated source-map file, as well as a RequireJS bundle index file (which isn't actually needed at runtime, so here just as a reference)),
which aggregates all the required code (external library dependencies included, such as Underscore, jQuery, etc.),
as well as the "Almond" lightweight AMD loader ( https://github.com/jrburke/almond ).

This means that the full RequireJS library ( http://requirejs.org ) is not actually needed to bootstrap the AMD modules at runtime,
as demonstrated by the HTML file in the `dev` folder (trimmed for brevity):

```html
<html>
<head>

<!-- main code bundle, which includes its own Almond AMD loader (no need for the full RequireJS library) -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_single-bundle/readium-js_all.js"> </script>

<!-- index.js calls into the above library -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="./index.js"> </script>

</head>
<body>
<div id="viewport"> </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Multiple bundles


The `_multiple-bundles` folder contains several Javascript bundles (and their respective source-map files, as well as RequireJS bundle index files):


* `readium-external-libs.js`: aggregated library dependencies (e.g. Underscore, jQuery, etc.)
* `readium-shared-js.js`: shared Readium code (basically, equivalent to the `js` folder of the "readium-shared-js" submodule)
* `readium-cfi-js.js`: Readium CFI library (basically, equivalent to the `js` folder of the readium-cfi-js submodule)
* `readium-js.js`: this Readium code (see the `js` folder, which includes epub-fetch and epub-model source code)
* `readium-plugin-example.js`: simple plugin demo
* `readium-plugin-annotations.js`: the annotation plugin (DOM selection + highlight), which bundle actually contains the "Backbone" library, as this dependency is not already included in the "external libs" bundle.
)

In addition, the folder contains the full `RequireJS.js` library ( http://requirejs.org ), as the above bundles do no include the lightweight "Almond" AMD loader ( https://github.com/jrburke/almond ).

Usage is demonstrated by the HTML file in the `dev` folder (trimmed for brevity):

```html
<html>
<head>

<!-- full RequireJS library -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/RequireJS.js"> </script>



<!-- individual bundles: -->

<!-- readium CFI library -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-cfi-js.js"> </script>

<!-- external libraries -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-external-libs.js"> </script>

<!-- readium itself -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-shared-js.js"> </script>

<!-- simple example plugin -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-plugin-example.js"> </script>

<!-- annotations plugin -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-plugin-annotations.js"> </script>

<!-- readium js -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-js.js"> </script>


<!-- index.js calls into the above libraries -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="./index.js"> </script>

</head>
<body>
<div id="viewport"> </div>
</body>
</html>
```


Note how the "external libs" set of AMD modules can be explicitly described using the `bundles` RequireJS configuration directive
(this eliminates the apparent opacity of such as large container of library dependencies):


```html

<script type="text/javascript">
requirejs.config({
    baseUrl: '../build-output/_multiple-bundles'
});
</script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-cfi-js.js.bundles.js"> </script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-external-libs.js.bundles.js"> </script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-shared-js.js.bundles.js"> </script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-plugin-example.js.bundles.js"> </script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-plugin-annotations.js.bundles.js"> </script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../build-output/_multiple-bundles/readium-js.js.bundles.js"> </script>

```




## CSON vs. JSON (package.json)

CSON = CoffeeScript-Object-Notation ( https://github.com/bevry/cson )

Running the command `npm run cson2json` will re-generate the `package.json` JSON file.
For more information, see comments in the master `package.cson` CSON file.

Why CSON? Because it is a lot more readable than JSON, and therefore easier to maintain.
The syntax is not only less verbose (separators, etc.), more importantly it allows *comments* and *line breaking*!

Although these benefits are not so critical for basic "package" definitions,
here `package.cson/json` declares relatively intricate `script` tasks that are used in the development workflow.
`npm run SCRIPT_NAME` offers a lightweight technique to handle most build tasks,
as NPM CLI utilities are available to perform cross-platform operations (agnostic to the actual command line interface / shell).
For more complex build processes, Grunt / Gulp can be used, but these build systems do not necessarily offer the most readable / maintainable options.

Downside: DO NOT invoke `npm init` or `npm install --save` `--save-dev` `--save-optional`,
as this would overwrite / update the JSON, not the master CSON!
